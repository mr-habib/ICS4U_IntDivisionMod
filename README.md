# ICS4U_IntDivisionMod

Your job is to create your own versions of the integer division and modulous operators.
You may not use the ```//``` or the ```%``` operators in your solution. The video posted for this assigent skims over a meaningful solution.

Your program should include:
Two ```input()``` statements prompting the user to input two numbers (or you can use one input() statement, either way 2 numbers...)
Two functions, one called ```int_div()``` and one called ```my_mod()```
A ```print()``` statement that displays the output to the user
